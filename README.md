Roles:

Your group may or may not want to consider assigning/volunteering for one or more of the following roles for this wiki project:

Team Lead
Editor
Researcher
Repo/Wiki Owner
The above list is in no way comprehensive, nor does it represent concrete roles that MUST be assigned.

Performing a specific role DOES NOT mean that you do not have to write a wiki page in addition to your role.

Even though this is a group assignment, each team member will be graded individually based on their contribution to the wiki (their page).
